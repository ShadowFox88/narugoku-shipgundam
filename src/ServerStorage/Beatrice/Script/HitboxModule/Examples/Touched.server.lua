-- BodyPart is the part you want the hitbox to be based off/welded off.
-- Damage is how much damage you want it to do, combine it with however you do damage.
-- MultiplySize has to be a number string, multiplies the size based off designated body part.
-- For body parts you can loop through a seperate table to make it clone multiple body parts and not just one
